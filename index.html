    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutral Harmony -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A single-page application with a fixed left-hand navigation sidebar for desktop and a pop-out menu for mobile. This structure provides clear, persistent navigation, allowing users to jump between key aspects of the professional narrative (Pillars, Experience, etc.) without losing context. The core of the application is an interactive "Four Pillars" section using clickable cards to reveal detailed information in a dedicated display area, promoting user engagement and focused exploration. A visual timeline for career experience and a dynamic chart for key growth metrics are included to make data easily digestible. This non-linear, thematic structure was chosen over a simple chronological resume to better highlight the core brand message of a multi-faceted executive, catering to high-level audiences like investors and partners who prioritize strategic capabilities over a simple work history. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: Golden Krust Growth Metrics (Locations, Team Size). Goal: Compare. Viz Method: Bar Chart (Chart.js). Interaction: Tooltips on hover. Justification: A bar chart provides a clear, immediate visual comparison of the "before and after" scale of the enterprise, which is more impactful than a static table. Library: Chart.js.
        - Report Info: The Four Pillars of the Brand. Goal: Organize & Inform. Viz Method: Interactive Cards (HTML/CSS/JS). Interaction: Click to expand/reveal details in a separate, dedicated container. Justification: Cards create a clean, modern dashboard feel. The click-to-reveal interaction encourages user engagement and breaks down large amounts of text into digestible, user-initiated chunks, improving comprehension and reducing cognitive load. Method: Vanilla JS.
        - Report Info: Career Experience. Goal: Show change & Inform. Viz Method: Vertical Timeline (HTML/CSS). Interaction: Content is presented chronologically. Justification: A timeline is the most intuitive way to present career progression, clearly showing the journey from one role to the next and how skills were compounded over time. Method: HTML/Tailwind CSS.
        - Report Info: Klayrock Client Results. Goal: Inform/Impact. Viz Method: "Stat Cards" with large numbers and brief descriptions. Interaction: Static display. Justification: High-impact numbers are best presented simply and boldly to grab attention and convey value quickly. Method: HTML/Tailwind CSS.
        - CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

It details a journey defined by identifying fragmentation and complexity, and engineering streamlined, scalable, and highly profitable solutions. Below, you can explore the core pillars of my professional brand, my detailed career history, and the key skills I leverage to drive growth and create value.</p>
                             <div class="space-y-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                                <p>As a serial entrepreneur and systems-driven operator, I have built my career on a simple premise: identifying fragmentation and complexity, and engineering streamlined, scalable, and highly profitable solutions. My journey began not on Wall Street, but in my childhood, immersed in the world of family business.</p>
                                <p>I grew up watching my parents, Keith and Bernadette Clayborne, build a diverse portfolio of businesses—from dry cleaners in New York to a marketing agency in the Bahamas and newspapers in South Florida. This upbringing was a real-world MBA in operations and deal-making, culminating in my direct involvement in valuing and negotiating the 2005 sale of my father's newspaper, 'The Broward Times'. This foundation in generational entrepreneurship, combined with a formal education in finance from Morehouse College and early career experience as a Financial Analyst at Banc of America Securities, gave me a unique, quantitative-yet-practical approach to building businesses.</p>
                                <p>Today, I am channeling this cumulative experience into my latest venture, Hurricane Ready. We are revolutionizing the fragmented home improvement market in South Florida. We are replacing the stress and inefficiency of the traditional model with transparency, value, and a commitment to an exceptional customer experience. I am always open to connecting with fellow entrepreneurs, investors, and business leaders. Whether you are seeking advisory on scaling your operations, evaluating a franchise or acquisition opportunity, or exploring strategic partnerships, let's connect and discuss how we can build something of value together.</p>
